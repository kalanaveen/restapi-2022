Build rest api in node js,express js.mongodb.This api can be used for ecommerce application or online food order application.
We used json web token for secure login like generate access token and refresh token.We also provide role to user like customer or admin.And only admin can add product
,update product and delete product.In add product section we used multer library for uploading image.Also we used joi library for validation.
we Handled carefully all errors and even created our own custom error handler.
